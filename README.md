# GridPointGameAITry

## This is our first try for using evolution AI algorithm with **Kantrveysel**.

We created a little game of grid with points from 0 to 4 and there is a dummy AI (work in progress of course) that tries to take the best point from its last 3 runs. It gets stuck of course but it also learns (_sometimes_). 
> It's still and probably will be a work in progress for a looooooong time.
